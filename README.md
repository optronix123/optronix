# Getting Started

### Use Leanpub to Write a Book and Create Ebook Files Using Git and GitHub <a id="h_8121cbb813"></a>

It's easy to create PDF, EPUB, and MOBI ebook files on Leanpub, using our Git and GitHub writing mode!

You can then self-publish your Leanpub-generated ebook files anywhere you like, including on Amazon KDP, Apple Books, Google Play, and elsewhere.

And of course, with just the click of a button, you can also publish your ebook any time on Leanpub's bookstore, and start earning **80% royalties** on every Leanpub sale!

Finally, you can also use Leanpub to [create a Print-Ready PDF](http://help.leanpub.com/en/articles/3333903-walkthrough-creating-a-print-ready-pdf-export-from-a-leanpub-book-manuscript-to-use-with-print-on-demand-services) that you can upload to print-on-demand services, so you can get your book into print, too!
